        <p>
          Celeste is a 2d plataform game originally lunched on January 2018. In
          the game you're Madeline, a girl who wants to get to the top of
          Celeste Mountain, getting through challenges presented both from the
          mountain and her inner self.
        </p>

        <p>
          Celeste is a beautiful game with a beautiful story. Recommended for
          those who appreciate a well told human tale and also like a gaming
          challenge. The game mechanics are responsive and give you the feel of
          true control of Madeline's movements. As you proced through the game,
          you'll get closer to the main character as her story unvails.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recommend you to play this game with a tissue by your side, tears can
          come at any moment.
